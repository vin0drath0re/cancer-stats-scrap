## Overviews

**Cancer** is a major public health concern, with millions of new cases and deaths reported annually. Understanding its incidence and mortality across populations is crucial for developing effective prevention, treatment, and resource allocation strategies. This project focuses on collecting cancer statistics data to assess its impact on overall cancer trends. By extracting and organizing this data, we aim to contribute towards a cause that can help in global health planning, policymaking, and targeted medical interventions.


## Data Source
The data was collected from the **World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)** website ([Global Cancer Data by Country](https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/global-cancer-data-by-country/)). **WCRF** is a globally recognized organization that provides comprehensive cancer statistics, including incidence, mortality rates, and Age-Standardized Rates (ASR) across different countries. The website offers detailed cancer data categorized by gender and population, making it a valuable source for cancer research.



## Importance of Extracted Data

The goal of this extraction is to provide an open-source resource containing global cancer statistics, including the number of patients, age-standardized rates (ASR), and mortality rates by country. By making this data publicly available and easily usable in for ML models, it can support research, policy-making, and educational initiatives aimed at addressing cancer-related challenges worldwide.

Here are some key points for viewing and analysing the data - 

* NMSC (Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer): A frequently occurring but less fatal skin cancer that can inflate cancer incidence figures without substantially affecting mortality rates.

* ASR (Age-Standardized Rate): A measure that adjusts for age distribution differences across populations, enabling fair comparisons of cancer burden between countries.


This extracted dataset provides valuable insights by:

*	Assessing the true cancer burden: By showcasing data with and without NMSC, we can differentiate between cancers with high mortality risks and those that are more common but less dangerous.
*	Understanding gender-based disparities: The dataset categorizes cancer incidence and mortality separately for Both Sexes, Men, and Women, allowing for gender-specific analysis and targeted healthcare strategies.
*	Guiding healthcare policies and resource allocation: By identifying high-risk regions and mortality patterns, governments and healthcare organizations can prioritize early detection programs, optimize treatment plans, and allocate medical resources more effectively to combat cancer mortality worldwide.
